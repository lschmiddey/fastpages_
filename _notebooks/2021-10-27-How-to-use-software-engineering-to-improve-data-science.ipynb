    "As a common Data Scientist, I know the pain. Usually, what we do is pretty straight forward processwise, but somehow this almost always end up with a code that has become so complex, it's hard to keep track. Moreover, most Data Scientist do not really care about Software Engineering and use functions and classes all over the place, without any proper thinking about it first. Admittedly, I also did code like that.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some time now I wanted to change this. After reading some books and articles about Software Engineering and watching a ton of YouTube tutorials on it (thanks so much internet!) I came up with a few ideas how every Data Scientist can and should improve her code. Let's start with the basic design pattern I found helpful for each of my Data Science projects."

It means that the design of your software (which, in the end, is what we are writing) should follow the data pipeline. What does this mean in action? Let me give you a brief example:"

    "First thing to notice here is that I combined the basic structure of a Conv1d layer in one function. Every Conv1d layer should have a BatchNorm followed by a ReLU. You can adjust this just as you like. Then, in the next step I created a function which basically makes the Conv1d layer repetitive, given a list of arguments you provide. So based on that list of arguments, you can have 1, 2, 3, 4 or as many layer as you would like. This then in turn is then used in the Classifier class, which is our main model. The convolutional part, here called *self.raw* is then build given on what we specify how the architecture should look like. The rest of the model I kept rather inflexible, which you could if you want also change. But let's see this in action:"
